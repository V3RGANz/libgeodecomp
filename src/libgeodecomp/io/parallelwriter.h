 * the simulator. Also, ParallelWriter registers at the
 * DistributedSimulator, which will delete it upon its destruction.
 * Never allocate a ParallelWriter on the stack!
 *
 * A conceptual difference from Writer should be noted: multiple
 * ParallelWriter objects of the same type will exists, typically one
 * per MPI process. Thus one either needs to use MPI IO or individual
 * files per instance. For other differences see below.
